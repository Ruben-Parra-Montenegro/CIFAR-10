This is a simple project worked on for my deep learning class to see the impact of pruning on neural networks.

both iterative and one shot pruning approaches were tested here.

Different amounts of pruning were tested as well as structured and unstructured pruning for each amount of pruning done.

This was made simple by using a R730 power edge server with 2 Nvidia Tesla K80's which comes out to 4 total GPU's and 48gb of combined vram.

I was able to save time by running all the scripts at the same time.

The paper is written to show the results and explain in more detail what is going on.

I dont think it is that great of a paper in the traditional sense but it works for me for now.
